Project Name: Millennial Scrabble

Project Description: 
It is very similar to a traditional game of Scrabble. You are shown a blank board, and given a hand of 7 tiles. You click these tiles and place them on the board to form words, and follow the rest of the rules of Scrabble to continue making words. You are playing against the computer, and after every turn you click the button "Play Computer Turn" to allow the computer to play, then "Your Turn" to play your turn again. 

Build Instructions:
Run "scrabbleRUN.py" in an editor order to run the game. No files should need set up, but you will need to have the file "scrabbleDictionary.txt" on your computer also to run it.

Additional Information:
No libraries need to be installed to run the program.

There are no shortcut commands that should be needed to get to any point in the game-- you can keep playing against the computer and eventually you will get to the end of the game.
